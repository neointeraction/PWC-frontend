# Career Library — normalization spec

**Status:** decisions confirmed (§7) — ready to build. **Goal:** let a counsellor/admin,
when adding a career (job role), **select existing** entrance exams / courses / colleges
from dropdowns **or add new** ones inline — instead of typing comma-separated free text.
That requires turning today's list-like columns into proper lookup + join tables.

## 1. What's fixed vs. what changes

The **taxonomy is fixed** — the client selects from existing values, doesn't invent new
ones:

- `cluster`, `industry`, `domain` — a fixed 3-level hierarchy. **✅ Done (2026-08-17):** these
  were normalized into the `CareerCluster` → `CareerIndustry` → `CareerDomain` tables (the
  `normalize_career_taxonomy` migration); the entry now carries a `domainId` FK, and the taxonomy
  is admin-managed + soft-deletable via `/api/v1/career-taxonomy/*`. `GET /career-library/filters`
  and `GET /career-taxonomy/tree` now source from those tables. See `docs/api-list.md` §"Career
  Taxonomy".

The **job role is the new record**, and adding one may introduce new exams/courses/colleges
(or reuse existing ones). Those are what we normalize.

## 2. Current fields — classification

| Field on `CareerLibraryEntry` | Today | Proposed |
|---|---|---|
| `cluster`, `industry`, `domain` | String (fixed taxonomy) | **✅ normalized** → `CareerCluster`/`CareerIndustry`/`CareerDomain` tables; entry now has a `domainId` FK (admin-managed via `/api/v1/career-taxonomy/*`) |
| `jobRole` | String | **unchanged** (the new record's label) |
| `aiResilienceGrade`, `aiResilienceComment`, `oneLineDescription` | scalar | **unchanged** |
| salary* / qualification* / `entranceExamsUGDescription` | scalar text | **unchanged** (free text) |
| `entranceExams` (UG), `entranceExamsPG` (PG) | `String[]` | **normalize** → `EntranceExam` lookup + join, with a UG/PG level |
| `topCourses` | `String[]` | **normalize** → `Course` lookup + join |
| *(colleges — none on the entry today; derived by `industry` value-match)* | *derived* | **new** → `Institution` lookup + join (curated per career) |
| `topCompanies` | `String[]` | **decision** — normalize to a `Company` lookup, or keep as free-text array |
| `certificationsStudent`, `certificationsUG` | `String[]` | **decision** — normalize to a `Certification` lookup (with stage), or keep free-text |

So the three the client explicitly named — **exams, courses, colleges** — are the core of
this change; companies and certifications are the fuzzy ones to decide on (§7).

## 3. What already exists (and why we can't just link to it as-is)

Imported source directories (matched by string value today, not FK-linked):

- `UgEntranceExam`, `PgEntranceExam` — exam directories, **split UG/PG**.
- `UgInstitution` (industry-scoped, **duplicated per industry**), `UgInstitutionUniversity`
  (a deduped general directory), `PgInstitution`.
- `UgCourse` — course directory (keyed by `careerCluster`).

These are messy source dumps (industry duplication, UG/PG split, many source-specific
columns). A dropdown wants a **clean, deduped, canonical list** — so the recommendation is
to introduce canonical lookup tables and seed them *from* these directories, keeping the
raw directories for the existing "related institutions/courses/exams" detail view.

## 4. Proposed schema (recommended shape)

### Canonical lookup tables (deduped, dropdown-friendly)

```prisma
enum QualificationLevel { UG PG }

model EntranceExam {
  id             String  @id @default(cuid())
  name           String  // e.g. "JEE Main"
  level          QualificationLevel
  fullForm       String?
  conductingBody String?
  officialWebsite String?
  // ...seeded from Ug/PgEntranceExam
  careerLinks    CareerEntranceExam[]
  @@unique([name, level])
}

model Institution {
  id       String  @id @default(cuid())
  name     String  @unique   // deduped college/university
  city     String?
  state    String?
  type     String?
  website  String?
  careerLinks CareerInstitution[]
}

model Course {
  id            String @id @default(cuid())
  name          String
  level         QualificationLevel
  fullForm      String?
  durationYears String?
  @@unique([name, level])
  careerLinks   CareerCourse[]
}
```

### Join tables (many-to-many: a career ↔ each lookup)

```prisma
model CareerEntranceExam {
  careerEntryId  String
  entranceExamId String
  careerEntry    CareerLibraryEntry @relation(fields: [careerEntryId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  entranceExam   EntranceExam       @relation(fields: [entranceExamId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  @@id([careerEntryId, entranceExamId])
}

model CareerInstitution {
  careerEntryId String
  institutionId String
  // ...relations, @@id([careerEntryId, institutionId])
}

model CareerCourse {
  careerEntryId String
  courseId      String
  kind          CourseLink? // optional: PRIMARY | ALTERNATE (source distinguishes these)
  // ...relations, @@id([careerEntryId, courseId])
}
```

`CareerLibraryEntry` gains the reverse relations (`entranceExams CareerEntranceExam[]`,
`institutions CareerInstitution[]`, `courses CareerCourse[]`) and, once backfilled, the old
`String[]` columns are dropped (see §6).

## 5. "Select existing or add new" — the API pattern

One entry create/update endpoint, no separate "create a college" call. Each normalized
field accepts a list where every item is **either an existing id or a new record**:

```jsonc
POST /api/v1/career-library
{
  "jobRole": "Robotics Engineer", "cluster": "...", "industry": "...", "domain": "...",
  "entranceExams": [ { "id": "exm_123" }, { "name": "New Exam", "level": "UG" } ],
  "institutions":  [ { "id": "ins_45" }, { "name": "New College", "city": "Pune" } ],
  "courses":       [ { "id": "crs_9" }, { "name": "B.Tech Robotics", "level": "UG" } ]
}
```

The service **find-or-creates** each `{name,...}` item (dedupe by name/level, case-
insensitive), then links via the join table. Plus new **typeahead endpoints** to feed the
dropdowns:

- `GET /api/v1/career-library/entrance-exams?search=&level=`
- `GET /api/v1/career-library/institutions?search=`
- `GET /api/v1/career-library/courses?search=&level=`

(Reads = any authenticated user; the create/link path stays admin.)

## 6. Migration & backfill plan

1. Add the new lookup + join tables (additive migration — safe).
2. **Seed canonical lookups** from the existing directories, deduped by name (+level):
   `EntranceExam` ← `Ug/PgEntranceExam`; `Institution` ← `UgInstitutionUniversity` +
   `PgInstitution`; `Course` ← `UgCourse`.
3. **Backfill joins** from each entry's existing arrays: split `entranceExams[]` /
   `entranceExamsPG[]` / `topCourses[]`, match (case-insensitive) or create the canonical
   row, create the join.
4. Colleges have no existing per-entry array — **seed each entry's institutions from its
   current industry value-match** (D3): for each career, take `UgInstitution` rows where
   `industry = career.industry`, map to the canonical `Institution` (find-or-create by
   name), and link. Entries then start with a full, editable college list.
5. Keep the old `String[]` columns for one transitional release (dual-read), then drop them
   in a follow-up migration once the join data is verified.

## 7. Decisions (confirmed)

- **D1 — Canonical tables.** ✅ New clean canonical `EntranceExam` / `Institution` /
  `Course` tables (seeded from the `Ug*`/`Pg*` directories); joins + dropdowns point at
  these. Raw directories kept for the existing detail view.
- **D2 — Scope.** ✅ Normalize **exams + courses + colleges** now. `topCompanies` and
  `certificationsStudent`/`certificationsUG` **stay free-text arrays** for now.
- **D3 — Colleges backfill.** ✅ **Seed each career's institutions from its industry
  value-match** (then editable), per §6-4.
- **D4 — UG/PG.** ✅ One lookup table per type with a `level` (`QualificationLevel`) field.
- **D5 — Old columns.** ✅ Keep the `String[]` columns through one transitional release,
  drop in a follow-up migration once verified.

## 8. Follow-ups shipped after §7 (2026-08-28)

- **Full detail on inline "add new".** The canonical lookups gained the columns the admin
  form actually collects (`EntranceExam`: `examMode`, `frequency`, `applicableFor`,
  `subjectRequirements12th`, `applicationWindow`; `Course`: `stream12thRequirements`,
  `relevantEntranceExams`, `programmesOffered`, `topColleges`, `furtherStudyOptions`;
  `Institution`: `shortName`, `entranceExamsRequired`, `programmesOffered`, `ranking`), and
  the `{ name, … }` link items accept them. A course's exam/college fields stay **free text**
  — a course is reference data, not a second place to curate per-career links.
- **Blank-fill, not overwrite.** Linking a name that already exists fills only columns that
  are still null. Canonical rows are shared across job roles, so an inline add while editing
  one role must not clobber another's data.
- **Domain-scoped typeahead.** `?domainId=` on the three dropdown endpoints answers "what
  does this domain already have", derived from the join tables — no extra schema.
- **Education Path** (`DomainEducationEntry` + `CareerEducationEntry`) is normalized at the
  **domain** level, managed under `/api/v1/career-taxonomy/`. Unlike exams/courses it is
  **not** dual-written back to the flat `qualification*`/`certifications*` strings: those
  hold workbook prose, not lists.

**Still open:** there is no endpoint to *edit* a canonical `EntranceExam`/`Course`/
`Institution` row. Blank-fill means a value entered wrong on first creation can only be
corrected in the database. Admin CRUD for the three lookup tables is the natural next step —
it also gives the "manage reference data" screen a home, separate from the job-role form.
```
